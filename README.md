# PIMA-Indians-Diabetes-Database
My first attempt to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

This problem is broken down into two sections - 
### 1. Data Pre-processing
  - Handling missing values
  - Adding extra features
  - Dealing with outliers

### 2. Model Building
Apply different Machine Learning algorithms to solve the classification problem.
 - Logistic Regression
 - Random Forest Classifier
 - XGBoost Classifier
 
### Conclusion
Accuracy of the three models -
1. Logistic Regression = 0.801
2. Random Forest Classifier = 0.819
3. XGBClassifier = 0.8108

This [blog](https://devanshu125.blogspot.com/2020/04/pima-indians-diabetes-database.html) describes my approach to solve the problem.
